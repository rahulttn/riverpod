**Work in progress**

This project is a work-in-progress command that analyzes a Riverpod project and
generates a graph of the interactions between providers/widgets

The graph generated is generated using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

Here is graph example, generated from the Flutter Devtool project (which uses Riverpod).
